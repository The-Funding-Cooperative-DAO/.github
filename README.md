[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/The-Funding-Cooperative-DAO/docs)](https://github.com/issues)

We are growing communities of DAOs via indexing, outreach, & funding.

By building a community-owned public good for the radically inclusive funding of all qualified innovators,
we can help to find and welcome > 1 million founders to web3.
