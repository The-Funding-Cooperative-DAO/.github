<h1 align="center">ðŸ’¡ The Funding Cooperative DAO</h1>

[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/The-Funding-Cooperative-DAO/docs)](https://github.com/issues)

The Funding Cooperative DAO is a new approach to help founders while increasing dramatically the number of qualified web3 founders. Founders and DAOs accepted as members of the Funding Cooperative DAO receive a shared token in return for a small portion of their tokens. This creates diversification, jump-starts community creation, and provides some liquidity as well. Gains are recycled into outreach and education, focusing especially on underrepresented groups.

We are growing communities of DAOs via indexing, outreach, & funding.

By building a community-owned public good for the radically inclusive funding of all qualified innovators,
we can help to find and welcome > 1 million founders to web3.
